# LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY

PROBLEM

To minimize the chance of losing money while making loans to clients by being aware of risk analytics in banking and financial services.

The bank's choice carries two different kinds of risks:

-If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

-If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
